fxkernel Depends on IPP libraries which must be installed. If you have
an existing DIFX installation and $PKG_CONFIG_PATH points to the
directory containing ipp.pc, then this should be picked
automatically. If you do not have ipp.pc installed, run "genipppc".

genipppc defaults to look for IPP in /opt/intel or $IPPROOT. If it is in neithe rlocation, pass the "root" directory of the intel as an argument to genipppc.

You will need to copy the generated ipp.pc file to a directory pointed to by $PKG_CONFIG_PATH (e.g. ~/lib/pkgconfig)

Then run:

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
